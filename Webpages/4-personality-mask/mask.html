     <h2> <strong> Theories </strong> </h2>
     <ul>
     <li> <h3><i> Psychodynamic</i> </h3> </li>
     <p style="margin-left: 60px">
        In the front, there's a split between the superego and the ego. The red side represents the superego because it often has to wrestle with my id. The color red also symbolizes caution so it's the superego stopping from doing something immoral. The purple color represents the ego, the ego follows the reality principle, so it has to be rational and calculating, purple is a cool color and is calming. The paper-mâché between the nose and mouth represents the id, it makes the mask look silly, or horrifying (I like both reactions either way). It's also coming out from within the mask, representing the fact that the id comes from the unconscious.
     </p>
     <li> <h3><i> Trait </i> </h3> </li>
     <p style="margin-left: 60px">
     There are two motifs and that's the colors blue and purple. The color purple is used to represent intelligence and calculating, and also the Architect personality type (INTJ). I generally just don't like expressing my thoughts so I just bury those thoughts in my head. The other motif blue represents my introversion. I smeared the area around my mouth with blue to represent my shyness/awkwardness. Blue is also around the eyes inside the mask representing my desire to be alone and not see anyone.     
      </p>
     <li> <h3><i> Humanism </i> </h3> </li>
     <p style="margin-left: 60px">
     In the back is sort of, if you squint until your eyes water, you may just notice Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. White represents biological needs. First, there was sunlight and then plants started to sprout, the first need is physiological needs, they're parallel. Blue represents bonds and relationships and being an introvert kind of says it all. Black represents my low self-esteem, no further comments. Purple represents self-actualization, the architect, and like the architect I want a job that's both technical and creative, then I'll share my wealth with the peasants or whatever when I'm in my 50s.
     </p>
     <li> <h3><i> Social Cognitive</i> </h3> </li>
     <p style="margin-left: 60px">
     The sun and the pseudo moon (the gray blob in the back) represent my attitude during "cooperation times" where I'm forced to socialize with other people much to my dismay, my very own school mask, how stylish! The "moon" represents my personal life, with my family I'm very rambunctious and obnoxious, but with other people I avoid them, the less socialization the better.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 60px"> The black and white present pessimism/Optimism, external/internal locus of control. The black color around the region of my brain, I'm generally pessimistic, the world is out of my control kind thoughts. The sinking of the Titanic is inevitable, enjoy the ride, or don't who cares, just don't tell me what to think I hate that. The white is around the mouth and that's because I tend to stay positive with verbal affirmations, sometimes it's the voice in my head, I love verbal affirmation it lifts my mood a bit if I just say something positive.
     </p>  
     </ul>
     
       <h2> <strong> Reflection </strong> </h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 60px">
        Overall the making of the mask was quite enjoyable, the most amusing thing is that I didn't have a paint bush. I'd ask my dad to buy paint the next time he bought groceries and he arrived home with tubes of paint, but no paintbrush. So I smeared anything with my fingers, which my Id enjoys quite a lot, I have a strong Id you see.
         </p>
         <p style="margin-left: 60px">
          I'm a selfish person, the discussion about perception of personalities encompasses too much the implications for society are too much for my tiny brain. I'm not a philosophical guy, I'm a technical guy, so I think in terms of myself just like a literal child. All I know is that everyone's got their perspective and opinions. For society to function everyone has to put their heads together and utilize their knowledge and perspective while behaving uniformly, and homogeneously, which is a contradiction that some other guy can think about, Socrates? Plato? Also, we miserably fail at viewing ourselves objectively. We just had to have a stupid defense mechanism to twist reality into whatever fantasy is most convenient. Is there even an objective way to think? We are a train and bias is our fuel.
