    <p>My test results illustrate that I'm centered on everything, except that
       I'm irritable, which I find pretty funny, and that I'm introverted. I'm in the middle of Openness
        so I'm not open to new experiences, but neither do I find comfort in a routine. I'm also centered
        for Consciousness so I'm not organized or disorganized, and also in the middle of responsible and
        irresponsible. Furthermore I'm centered again on Neuroticism, but a bit on the left. I guess I'm
        a pretty chill person, if not a bit awkward; if I took this test during the lockdown or last year
        I would be closer to the right because I didn't think well of myself, after getting bad grades, and
        experiencing deep shame I've just kind of mellowed out, my shame resistance is like 90%. Finally for
        agreeableness and extraversion I skewed mostly to the left, not very surprising that I'm an introvert
        and get irritated at other people, I mean I just love long walks alone on a beach, with no noise and
        no dog turd in sight. I'm awkward around people, so  I get irritated when someone is pushing me out of
        my comfort zone. Overall I agree with the assessments, they were all pretty good, but there were some
        scenarios I've never been in, or thought about for more than 1/10th of a second, so I might've skewed 
        it a bit.

    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">16 Personalities</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">

    <p>In 16personalities.com I scored the highest on Introverted, Intuitive
      , Thinking, and Judging, so the site assigned me as an Architect (INTJ). The Architect is 
      intelligent and rational, they're the innovators and pioneers of the world, not only do they 
      work hard, they are archivers. They're not all machines, they're not emotional, but they are 
      human after all, they will feel hurt when hurt has been done onto them. .I disagree with their 
      assessment. I have a just enough mentality, I'm not an overachiever. Part of the reason for my 
      mentality is me being lazy, and the other is my low self-esteem. Mediocre sounds kind of harsh, 
      so I tend to avoid that label, but I certainly don't think of myself as above average. From the 
      introduction for the Architect personality, it describes people with this personality type as 
      inquisitive, intelligent, and condescending. Holier than thou matches this personality type perfectly.
       Maybe because I don't agree with the assessment that I'm interpreting Architect negatively, but one of 
       the weaknesses for Architects is arrogance, so that probably influenced my opinion, or I myself am arrogant
       , and so I can't see my own arrogance. I'm not inquisitive, like a knowledge seeker, I'm not a bank of 
       information either, but I'm certainly condescending. I can not lie, I am kind of an a-hole, when my anxiety 
       doesn't stop me from social interactions. If condescending was the only descriptor, I'd agree with the assessment
       . I'll praise the test for getting the judging part correct.
